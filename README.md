# Web App for Taking Notes During Courses

A Single Page Application (SPA) designed to help students organize, manage, and share their course and lab notes.

The platform is based on a web application with a SPA architecture, accessible in a browser from a desktop, mobile device, or tablet. The note editor is easy to use for taking information during class and implements a markdown system for text formatting.
